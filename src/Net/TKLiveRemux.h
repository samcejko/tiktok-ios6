// plays: the FLV's H.264 pictures and AAC sound go unchanged into MPEG-TS segments, cut at key frames about every two
// seconds and listed in a sliding live HLS playlist. Nothing is decoded or re-encoded; the stream comes straight from
// TikTok's CDN. One instance per stream, reading on a thread of its own until stopped or no longer asked for.
