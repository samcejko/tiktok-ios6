// Our own "For You". Candidates come from TikTok's logged-out Explore feed - a fresh batch per topic, so the supply
// never runs out - and now and then from a creator you follow (optional; the feed needs none). Which topics to ask
// for is drawn from what you liked (TKTaste); each next video is the best-scoring candidate with some randomness,
// a share of pure exploration (large at first, never zero), and rules that keep the feed varied: not the same
// creator twice within a few videos, rarely the same topic three times running.
