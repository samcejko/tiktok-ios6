// The viewer's taste, learned only from how they watch (it never leaves the device):
//  - a weight per feature of a video - its topic, hashtags, creator, shared sound, caption language and length.
//    Finishing or saving a video raises the weights of its features, swiping it away lowers them;
//  - a success record per Explore topic, from which -topicsToFetch: draws (Thompson sampling): topics that
//    worked come up more often, untried and uncertain ones still get their turn.
// Old lessons slowly fade, so a changing taste shows through.
